<h2 id="org3fad9f1">1. Building a pedigree</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3fad9f1">
<p>
A pedigree is a graphical representation of a person's family medical history that is used to identify patterns of inheritance and to assess the risk of a genetic condition running in a family.
</p>

<p>
Building a pedigree involves gathering information about a person's family medical history and using symbols to represent family members and their relationships to each other.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of how to build a pedigree:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify the proband: The proband is the individual in the family who is affected by a genetic condition or is seeking information about their risk of developing a genetic condition.</li>

<li>Gather information: Collect information about the health of family members, including any genetic conditions that run in the family, the age of onset, and the specific symptoms or complications associated with the condition.</li>

<li>Draw the pedigree: Use symbols to represent family members and their relationships to each other. For example, a square can be used to represent a male, a circle can be used to represent a female, and a horizontal line can be used to connect a parent to a child.</li>

<li>Identify affected individuals: Use a filled-in symbol to represent individuals who are affected by a genetic condition.</li>

<li>Identify the mode of inheritance: Use specific symbols or colors to indicate the mode of inheritance, such as an "A" for autosomal dominant or an "X" for X-linked.</li>

<li>Add information about the proband: Use a double-lined symbol to represent the proband and add information about their specific genetic condition or test results.</li>

<li>Label the pedigree: Add labels to the pedigree, such as the names of family members and their ages, to make it easier to understand.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="orgbc868c9">2. Genetic anamnesis</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbc868c9">
<p>
Genetic anamnesis is the process of gathering information about a person's family medical history in order to identify any inherited genetic conditions or inherited risk factors for certain diseases.
</p>

<p>
The information gathered during a genetic anamnesis is used to assess an individual's risk of developing a genetic disorder and to make informed decisions about genetic testing and preventive measures.
</p>

<p>
The process of genetic anamnesis typically involves:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Taking a detailed family medical history: This includes asking questions about the health of family members, including any genetic conditions that run in the family, age of onset, and the specific symptoms or complications associated with the condition.</li>

<li>Identifying patterns of inheritance: Genetic conditions can be inherited in different patterns, such as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Understanding the pattern of inheritance can help to predict the risk of a genetic condition in family members.</li>

<li>Assessing risk: Based on the information gathered during the genetic anamnesis, an individual's risk of developing a genetic condition can be assessed. This information can be used to make decisions about genetic testing and preventive measures.</li>

<li>Genetic Counseling: Genetic counseling is recommended after genetic anamnesis to give individuals and their families the opportunity to discuss the risks and benefits of genetic testing and to make informed decisions about their health care.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org20e6b73">
<p>
The type of inheritance refers to the pattern in which a genetic trait or disorder is passed down from one generation to the next. The five main types of inheritance are
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance</b>: This type of inheritance occurs when a gene located on one of the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) is dominant and only one copy of the gene is needed to express the trait or disorder. If a person inherits the gene from one parent, they will have the condition. The risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 50% for each pregnancy.</li>

<li><b>Autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance</b>: This type of inheritance occurs when a gene located on one of the autosomes is recessive and two copies of the gene are needed to express the trait or disorder. If a person inherits one copy of the gene from each parent, they will not have the condition, but they will be a carrier of the gene. The risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 25% for each pregnancy if both parents are carriers of the gene.</li>

<li><b>X-linked dominant (XD) inheritance</b>: This type of inheritance occurs when a gene located on the X chromosome is dominant. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Females are more likely to be affected than males. The risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 50% for each pregnancy if the mother is affected.</li>

<li><b>X-linked recessive (XR) inheritance</b>: This type of inheritance occurs when a gene located on the X chromosome is recessive. Males are more likely to be affected than females because they only have one X chromosome. The risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 50% for each pregnancy if the father is affected.</li>

<li><b>Mitochondrial inheritance</b>: This type of inheritance occurs when a gene located in the mitochondria, the organelles that produce energy for the cell, is passed down from the mother. The risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 100% if the mother is affected, as all of the egg's mitochondria are passed on to the offspring.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In terms of risk calculation, in AD inheritance the risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 50% for each pregnancy. In AR inheritance the risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 25% if both parents are carriers. For XD and XR inheritance the risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 50% if the mother or father is affected respectively. In mitochondrial inheritance the risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 100% if the mother is affected.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org882e90a">
<p>
Beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations in the HBB gene, which provides instructions for making the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The HBB gene is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 11, specifically on position 11p15.5.</li>
<li>Hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, is made up of two alpha-globin and two beta-globin subunits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beta-thalassemia occurs due to a genetic defect in one or both copies of the HBB gene that impairs the production of beta-globin. This leads to a shortage of beta-globin, which in turn causes the characteristic anemia and other symptoms seen in individuals with beta-thalassemia.
</p>


<p>
<i>The disorder is characterized by severe anemia and a variety of symptoms including fatigue, weakness, growth delays, and bone deformities.</i>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfe4ef8a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfe4ef8a">Beta thalessemia major vs minor</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfe4ef8a">
<p>
The main difference between the two forms is the severity of the symptoms and the level of anemia.
</p>

<p>
Beta-thalassemia major, <i>also known as Cooley's anemia</i>, is the most severe form of the disorder.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is caused by two copies of the HBB gene containing the mutation.</li>
<li>As a result, the body produces very little or no functional beta-globin.</li>
<li>This leads to a severe shortage of functional hemoglobin, causing severe anemia, fatigue, weakness, growth delays, and bone deformities.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beta-thalassemia major is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood and requires regular blood transfusions for survival.
</p>

<p>
Beta-thalassemia minor, also known as thalassemia trait or heterozygous beta-thalassemia,
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>caused by a mutation in only one copy of the HBB gene.</li>
<li>The body produces some functional beta-globin, but not enough to meet the body's needs.</li>
<li>As a result, individuals with this form of the disorder have mild to moderate anemia. They typically do not have any symptoms and only require treatment if they develop severe anemia. They can be carriers and passing on the gene to their children.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>In summary, beta-thalassemia major is a severe form of the disorder that causes severe anemia and various symptoms, and requires regular blood transfusions for survival. Beta-thalassemia minor is a mild form of the disorder that causes mild to moderate anemia and typically does not require treatment.</i>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org584d823">
<p>
FMR1-associated diseases are a group of disorders caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene. The most well-known of these disorders is Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The FMR1 gene is located on the X chromosome at a location designated Xq27.3 and encodes for the protein Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) which is essential for normal cognitive development and function.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>The FMR1 gene has a variable number of repeats of a trinucleotide sequence (CGG) in its promoter region, and when these repeats are too many, over 200, it leads to a condition called a full mutation and that leads to FXS. Individuals with 55-200 CGG repeats have a premutation of the FMR1 gene, which can lead to other disorders such as Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) in adult males and Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) in females.</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The inheritance pattern of FMR1-associated diseases is X-linked dominant, which means that the gene is located on the X chromosome and only one copy of the gene needs to be affected to cause the disorder.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, the phenotype, or the expression of the disorder, may vary among carriers of the premutation and females tend to have less severe symptoms than males.</li>

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are both forms of muscular dystrophy that are caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The dystrophin gene is located on the X chromosome at Xp21.2 and encodes for the protein dystrophin, which is important for the stability and function of muscle fibers.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DMD is a severe form of the disorder that typically presents in early childhood and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, with difficulty in walking and standing, and eventual loss of the ability to walk. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in the complete absence of dystrophin protein.</li>

<li>BMD, on the other hand, is a milder form of the disorder that typically presents in late childhood or early adulthood and is characterized by a slowly progressive muscle weakness. BMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in the production of an altered but partially functional dystrophin protein.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org39b9c5d">
<p>
Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a loss or dysfunction of a specific region on chromosome 15, specifically a region called the Angelman critical region (ACR) on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13). This region contains several genes that play a crucial role in brain development.
</p>

<p>
The most common cause of Angelman syndrome is a deletion of the ACR on the maternal chromosome 15. In about 3-4% of cases, it is caused by a mutation in the UBE3A gene which is located within the ACR. In rare cases, it is caused by a defect in the imprinting process, which results in the paternal copy of the chromosome 15 being active instead of the maternal copy.
</p>

<p>
The clinical picture of Angelman syndrome is characterized by a combination of symptoms, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech impairment, and difficulty with balance and motor coordination. Other common symptoms include a characteristic facial appearance, seizures, and a happy and sociable personality.

Prevention of DiGeorge syndrome is not currently possible as it is caused by a genetic disorder that occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells and it is not inherited. It is not caused by anything the parents did or did not do.
However, there are some options for individuals who are at increased risk of having a child with DiGeorge syndrome. These include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Genetic counseling: Genetic counseling can provide individuals who are at increased risk of having a child with DiGeorge syndrome with information about their options and the potential risks. A genetic counselor can explain the risks of having a child with the condition and can discuss options such as prenatal testing, adoption, and donor egg or sperm.</li>

<li>Prenatal testing: Prenatal testing can identify DiGeorge syndrome during pregnancy, allowing parents to make informed decisions about the pregnancy.

<p>
Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Lynch Syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of several genes that are responsible for repairing DNA damage, including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>MSH2, located on chromosome 2p16.3</li>
<li>MSH6, located on chromosome 2p16.1</li>
<li>PMS2, located on chromosome 7p22.1</li>
</ul>

<p>
Mutations in these genes lead to a defect in DNA mismatch repair, which results in an increased risk of developing cancer. Lynch syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation.
