<h2 id="org3ae4f75">1. Building a pedigree</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3ae4f75">
<p>
A pedigree is a graphical representation of a person's family medical history that is used to identify patterns of inheritance and to assess the risk of a genetic condition running in a family.
</p>

<p>
Building a pedigree involves gathering information about a person's family medical history and using symbols to represent family members and their relationships to each other.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of how to build a pedigree:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify the proband: The proband is the individual in the family who is affected by a genetic condition or is seeking information about their risk of developing a genetic condition.</li>

<li>Gather information: Collect information about the health of family members, including any genetic conditions that run in the family, the age of onset, and the specific symptoms or complications associated with the condition.</li>

<li>Draw the pedigree: Use symbols to represent family members and their relationships to each other. For example, a square can be used to represent a male, a circle can be used to represent a female, and a horizontal line can be used to connect a parent to a child.</li>

<li>Identify affected individuals: Use a filled-in symbol to represent individuals who are affected by a genetic condition.</li>

<li>Identify the mode of inheritance: Use specific symbols or colors to indicate the mode of inheritance, such as an "A" for autosomal dominant or an "X" for X-linked.</li>

<li>Add information about the proband: Use a double-lined symbol to represent the proband and add information about their specific genetic condition or test results.</li>

<li>Label the pedigree: Add labels to the pedigree, such as the names of family members and their ages, to make it easier to understand.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="orge11ac17">2. Genetic anamnesis</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge11ac17">
<p>
Genetic anamnesis is the process of gathering information about a person's family medical history in order to identify any inherited genetic conditions or inherited risk factors for certain diseases.
</p>

<p>
The information gathered during a genetic anamnesis is used to assess an individual's risk of developing a genetic disorder and to make informed decisions about genetic testing and preventive measures.
</p>

<p>
The process of genetic anamnesis typically involves:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Taking a detailed family medical history: This includes asking questions about the health of family members, including any genetic conditions that run in the family, age of onset, and the specific symptoms or complications associated with the condition.</li>

<li>Identifying patterns of inheritance: Genetic conditions can be inherited in different patterns, such as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Understanding the pattern of inheritance can help to predict the risk of a genetic condition in family members.</li>

<li>Assessing risk: Based on the information gathered during the genetic anamnesis, an individual's risk of developing a genetic condition can be assessed. This information can be used to make decisions about genetic testing and preventive measures.</li>

<li>Genetic Counseling: Genetic counseling is recommended after genetic anamnesis to give individuals and their families the opportunity to discuss the risks and benefits of genetic testing and to make informed decisions about their health care.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is important to note that genetic anamnesis is not only important for identifying inherited genetic conditions but also for identifying predisposition to common diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.

<h2 id="org78d45d3">3. Determining type of inheritance and risk calculation in AR, AD, XD, XR, mitochondrial inheritance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org78d45d3">
<p>
The type of inheritance refers to the pattern in which a genetic trait or disorder is passed down from one generation to the next. The five main types of inheritance are
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance</b>: This type of inheritance occurs when a gene located on one of the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) is dominant and only one copy of the gene is needed to express the trait or disorder. If a person inherits the gene from one parent, they will have the condition. The risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 50% for each pregnancy.</li>

<li><b>Autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance</b>: This type of inheritance occurs when a gene located on one of the autosomes is recessive and two copies of the gene are needed to express the trait or disorder. If a person inherits one copy of the gene from each parent, they will not have the condition, but they will be a carrier of the gene. The risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 25% for each pregnancy if both parents are carriers of the gene.</li>

<li><b>X-linked dominant (XD) inheritance</b>: This type of inheritance occurs when a gene located on the X chromosome is dominant. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Females are more likely to be affected than males. The risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 50% for each pregnancy if the mother is affected.</li>

<li><b>X-linked recessive (XR) inheritance</b>: This type of inheritance occurs when a gene located on the X chromosome is recessive. Males are more likely to be affected than females because they only have one X chromosome. The risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 50% for each pregnancy if the father is affected.</li>

<li><b>Mitochondrial inheritance</b>: This type of inheritance occurs when a gene located in the mitochondria, the organelles that produce energy for the cell, is passed down from the mother. The risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 100% if the mother is affected, as all of the egg's mitochondria are passed on to the offspring.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In terms of risk calculation, in AD inheritance the risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 50% for each pregnancy. In AR inheritance the risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 25% if both parents are carriers. For XD and XR inheritance the risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 50% if the mother or father is affected respectively. In mitochondrial inheritance the risk of an offspring inheriting the condition is 100% if the mother is affected.

<h2 id="org1b53985">4. Diagnosis, treatment and prevention of beta-thalassemia major. Heterozygous carrier screening - beta-thalassemia minor</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1b53985">
<p>
Beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations in the HBB gene, which provides instructions for making the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The HBB gene is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 11, specifically on position 11p15.5.</li>
<li>Hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, is made up of two alpha-globin and two beta-globin subunits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beta-thalassemia occurs due to a genetic defect in one or both copies of the HBB gene that impairs the production of beta-globin. This leads to a shortage of beta-globin, which in turn causes the characteristic anemia and other symptoms seen in individuals with beta-thalassemia.
</p>


<p>
<i>The disorder is characterized by severe anemia and a variety of symptoms including fatigue, weakness, growth delays, and bone deformities.</i>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3e2930a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3e2930a">Beta thalessemia major vs minor</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3e2930a">
<p>
The main difference between the two forms is the severity of the symptoms and the level of anemia.
</p>

<p>
Beta-thalassemia major, <i>also known as Cooley's anemia</i>, is the most severe form of the disorder.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is caused by two copies of the HBB gene containing the mutation.</li>
<li>As a result, the body produces very little or no functional beta-globin.</li>
<li>This leads to a severe shortage of functional hemoglobin, causing severe anemia, fatigue, weakness, growth delays, and bone deformities.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beta-thalassemia major is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood and requires regular blood transfusions for survival.
</p>

<p>
Beta-thalassemia minor, also known as thalassemia trait or heterozygous beta-thalassemia,
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>caused by a mutation in only one copy of the HBB gene.</li>
<li>The body produces some functional beta-globin, but not enough to meet the body's needs.</li>
<li>As a result, individuals with this form of the disorder have mild to moderate anemia. They typically do not have any symptoms and only require treatment if they develop severe anemia. They can be carriers and passing on the gene to their children.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>In summary, beta-thalassemia major is a severe form of the disorder that causes severe anemia and various symptoms, and requires regular blood transfusions for survival. Beta-thalassemia minor is a mild form of the disorder that causes mild to moderate anemia and typically does not require treatment.</i>

<h3 id="org1d37174">Heterozygous carrier screening</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1d37174">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Heterozygous carrier screening is a genetic testing process that is used to identify individuals who carry one copy of a disease-causing mutation.</li>
<li>These individuals, known as heterozygous carriers, typically do not have any symptoms of the disorder themselves, but they can pass the mutation on to their children, putting them at risk of developing the disorder.</li>

<li>Heterozygous carrier screening typically involves a blood test or a saliva sample that is analyzed for the presence of specific genetic mutations associated with a particular disorder.</li>
<li>The testing process usually involves PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to amplifying the specific region of the gene to detect any variations, followed by Sanger sequencing or Next-generation sequencing (NGS) to determine the nucleotide sequence of the gene.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>The screening is offered to people of certain ethnic backgrounds where the incidence of certain disorders is more common. For example, in the case of beta-thalassemia, carrier screening is offered to individuals of Mediterranean, African, or Southeast Asian descent, where the disorder is prevalent.</i>

<h3 id="org636bd11">Diagnosis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org636bd11">
<p>
<i>Diagnosis of beta-thalassemia major typically involves a combination of blood tests and genetic testing.</i>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Blood tests such as complete blood count (CBC) and hemoglobin electrophoresis can reveal low hemoglobin levels and an abnormal hemoglobin pattern, while genetic testing can confirm the presence of a beta-thalassemia mutation.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Signs and symptoms include pale skin, fatigue, weakness, and slow growth.</li>
<li>A complete blood count (CBC) will show low levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells.</li>
<li>A hemoglobin electrophoresis test can confirm the diagnosis by showing low levels of hemoglobin A (the most common form of hemoglobin) and high levels of hemoglobin F (a fetal form of hemoglobin).</li>
<li>Genetic testing can also be used to confirm the diagnosis.</li>

<h3 id="org15a8629">Treatment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org15a8629">
<p>
Treatment for beta-thalassemia major typically involves regular blood transfusions to replace the missing hemoglobin, as well as iron chelation therapy to remove the excess iron that builds up in the body as a result of the transfusions.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Additionally, regular monitoring for complications of the disease, such as bone deformities and growth delays, is necessary.</li>

<li>A cure for beta-thalassemia major exists with Bone marrow transplantation(BMT) from a matched donor.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Also, gene therapy is a potential treatment for the disease as well, but it is still considered experimental at this time.</i>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Beta thalessemia minor requires no treatment, but patients can pass the mutation on to their children</li>

<h3 id="org6d06e46">Prevention</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d06e46">
<p>
Beta-thalassemia major begins with identifying individuals who are carriers of the disease-causing mutation and providing genetic counseling and prenatal testing to families at risk.

<p>
Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis typically involves a combination of tests, including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sweat test: The most common diagnostic test for CF, which measures the amount of salt in a person's sweat. Individuals with CF typically have higher levels of salt in their sweat than those without the disorder.</li>
<li>Genetic testing: Blood test that can identify the presence of specific genetic mutations associated with CF.</li>
<li>Lung function test: To measure the amount of air a person can inhale and exhale, and how quickly they can exhale.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Imaging studies: such as a chest X-ray or CT scan, to evaluate the lungs and any infections or blockages.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge59158f">
<p>
FMR1-associated diseases are a group of disorders caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene. The most well-known of these disorders is Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The FMR1 gene is located on the X chromosome at a location designated Xq27.3 and encodes for the protein Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) which is essential for normal cognitive development and function.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>The FMR1 gene has a variable number of repeats of a trinucleotide sequence (CGG) in its promoter region, and when these repeats are too many, over 200, it leads to a condition called a full mutation and that leads to FXS. Individuals with 55-200 CGG repeats have a premutation of the FMR1 gene, which can lead to other disorders such as Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) in adult males and Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) in females.</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The inheritance pattern of FMR1-associated diseases is X-linked dominant, which means that the gene is located on the X chromosome and only one copy of the gene needs to be affected to cause the disorder.

<p>
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue in the body, leading to problems in the bones, eyes, heart, and blood vessels.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The disorder is caused by mutations in the Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene, which is located on chromosome 15 (15q21.1) and encodes for the protein fibrillin-1, which is an essential component of connective tissue.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The mutations in the FBN1 gene lead to decreased production or abnormal formation of fibrillin-1, which affects the elasticity of connective tissue, leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that an individual only needs to inherit one copy of the defective gene from one parent to have the disorder.

<p>
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder that affects the nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>SMA is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene located on chromosome 5q13.3. This gene produces a protein called survival motor neuron (SMN), which is critical for the survival and function of motor neurons.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are several types of SMA, with type 1 being the most severe form, typically presenting in infancy and characterized by severe muscle weakness, difficulty in swallowing and breathing.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org75fb5c1">
<p>
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are both forms of muscular dystrophy that are caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The dystrophin gene is located on the X chromosome at Xp21.2 and encodes for the protein dystrophin, which is important for the stability and function of muscle fibers.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DMD is a severe form of the disorder that typically presents in early childhood and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, with difficulty in walking and standing, and eventual loss of the ability to walk. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in the complete absence of dystrophin protein.</li>

<li>BMD, on the other hand, is a milder form of the disorder that typically presents in late childhood or early adulthood and is characterized by a slowly progressive muscle weakness. BMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in the production of an altered but partially functional dystrophin protein.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both DMD and BMD are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, which means that the gene is located on the X chromosome and it is inherited in a recessive fashion, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent, to have the disorder. Females are typically carriers of the disorder and may not have symptoms, while males are mostly affected by the disorder.

<p>
Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects males and is caused by an extra X chromosome. Instead of the typical XY chromosomes, individuals with Klinefelter syndrome have at least one extra X chromosome (XXY, XXXY, XXXXY) which leads to a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the typical 46.

</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This extra X chromosome can lead to a variety of physical and developmental characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most common symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome are tall stature, small testes, and difficulty with spatial perception and fine motor skills.

<h2 id="org7446e8d">24. Diagnosis, treatment, risk assessment and prevention of Angelman syndrome</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7446e8d">
<p>
Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a loss or dysfunction of a specific region on chromosome 15, specifically a region called the Angelman critical region (ACR) on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13). This region contains several genes that play a crucial role in brain development.
</p>

<p>
The most common cause of Angelman syndrome is a deletion of the ACR on the maternal chromosome 15. In about 3-4% of cases, it is caused by a mutation in the UBE3A gene which is located within the ACR. In rare cases, it is caused by a defect in the imprinting process, which results in the paternal copy of the chromosome 15 being active instead of the maternal copy.
</p>

<p>
The clinical picture of Angelman syndrome is characterized by a combination of symptoms, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech impairment, and difficulty with balance and motor coordination. Other common symptoms include a characteristic facial appearance, seizures, and a happy and sociable personality.

<h3 id="org7a9f579">Prevention</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7a9f579">
<p>
Prevention of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is primarily focused on detecting and removing colonic polyps before they have the opportunity to become cancerous. The most effective way to prevent colon cancer in individuals with FAP is through prophylactic colectomy, which involves removing the entire colon and rectum. This procedure can reduce the risk of colon cancer by nearly 100%.
</p>

<p>
Other options for preventing colon cancer in individuals with FAP include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Surveillance: Regular surveillance, such as colonoscopy and stool-based tests, can detect and remove new polyps as early as possible. Individuals with FAP should undergo surveillance starting at a young age, typically between the ages of 10 and 12, and continue throughout their lifetime.</li>

<li>Medications: Medications such as Sulindac, celecoxib, and etodolac may be used to reduce the number of polyps in the colon and rectum.</li>

<li>Chemoprevention: Chemoprevention is the use of medications, vitamins, or other agents to reduce the risk of cancer. Some studies have suggested that the use of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce the risk of colon cancer in individuals with FAP.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga940db7">
<p>
Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Lynch Syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of several genes that are responsible for repairing DNA damage, including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MLH1, located on chromosome 3p22.2</li>
<li>MSH2, located on chromosome 2p16.3</li>
<li>MSH6, located on chromosome 2p16.1</li>
<li>PMS2, located on chromosome 7p22.1</li>
</ul>

<p>
Mutations in these genes lead to a defect in DNA mismatch repair, which results in an increased risk of developing cancer. Lynch syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation.

<h3 id="org91141c3">Diagnosis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org91141c3">
<p>
The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome typically begins with a thorough medical history and physical examination, followed by genetic testing to check for specific genetic mutations associated with the disorder. If the genetic test results are positive, additional testing such as endoscopic examinations and imaging tests may be done to check for signs of cancer.

<h3 id="org4e41dc6">Treatment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4e41dc6">
<p>
Treatment for Lynch syndrome will depend on the type and stage of cancer that is present. Some common treatments include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Surgery: Surgery is the most common treatment for colon and endometrial cancer associated with Lynch syndrome. The goal of surgery is to remove the cancerous tissue and any affected lymph nodes.</li>

<li>Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells and can be used before or after surgery to shrink a tumor or kill any remaining cancer cells.</li>

<li>Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. It may be used in combination with surgery or chemotherapy.</li>

<li>Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy is a newer type of cancer treatment that targets specific mutations in cancer cells, making it more effective and less toxic than traditional chemotherapy.</li>

<li>Surveillance program: Close monitoring of Lynch syndrome patients with colonoscopy, endoscopy and imaging tests may be done to detect early signs of cancer and to reduce the risk of developing cancer.</li>

Risk assessment and prevention are important for individuals with Lynch syndrome, as well as for their family members who may also be at risk.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Genetic counseling: Genetic counseling is recommended for individuals with Lynch syndrome and their family members. A genetic counselor can help you understand your risk of developing cancer and can also recommend additional testing and cancer screenings.</li>

<li>Cancer screenings: Regular cancer screenings, such as colonoscopies and endometrial biopsies, are important for detecting cancer early in individuals with Lynch syndrome. The frequency and timing of these screenings will depend on the individual's specific genetic mutations and family history.</li>

<li>Lifestyle changes: Individuals with Lynch syndrome can reduce their risk of developing cancer by making lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy diet and weight, exercising regularly, not smoking and limiting alcohol consumption.</li>

<li>Prophylactic surgery: In some cases, prophylactic surgery may be recommended to remove the colon, uterus, or other organs at high risk of cancer development.</li>

<li>Chemoprevention: Individuals with Lynch Syndrome may take medication such as aspirin which have been shown to reduce the risk of colon cancer.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2cc180d">
<p>
Targeted therapy is a form of cancer treatment that targets specific mutations or proteins in cancer cells, making it more effective and less toxic than traditional chemotherapy.
</p>

<p>
There are several genetic markers that have been identified as being associated with targeted therapy in breast cancer, including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2): HER2 is a protein that helps cancer cells grow and divide. About 15-20% of breast cancers are HER2-positive, and these tumors tend to be more aggressive. Targeted therapy drugs, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) and pertuzumab (Perjeta) can be used to target HER2-positive breast cancer.</li>

<li>ER (estrogen receptor) and PR (progesterone receptor): These receptors help to regulate the growth of breast cancer cells. About 70% of breast cancers are ER-positive and/or PR-positive, and these tumors tend to be less aggressive. Targeted therapy drugs, such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant, can be used to target ER-positive and/or PR-positive breast cancer.</li>

<li>BRCA1 and BRCA2: mutations in these genes are associated with an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Targeted therapy drugs, such as olaparib (Lynparza) and rucaparib (Rubraca) can be used to target BRCA1 and BRCA2-associated breast cancer.</li>

<li>PIK3CA: This gene encodes for a protein that plays a role in cell growth and division. Mutations in this gene can be seen in around 20% of breast cancer cases. Targeted therapy drugs such as alpelisib (Piqray) can be used to target PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer.</li>

<p>
Prenatal and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) are two different methods used to identify genetic conditions or genetic disorders before a baby is born or an embryo is implanted.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prenatal diagnosis: Prenatal diagnosis is used to detect genetic conditions or chromosomal abnormalities in a developing fetus during pregnancy. It can be done through a variety of methods such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS), amniocentesis, and non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Prenatal diagnosis can be offered to women who are at increased risk of having a child with a genetic condition due to their age, family history, or previous pregnancies affected by genetic disorders.</li>

<li>Pre-implantation diagnosis (PGD): PGD is a method used to identify genetic conditions in embryos before they are implanted in the uterus. It is typically used in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures and involves removing one or two cells from a developing embryo and testing them for specific genetic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities. PGD can be used to screen embryos for genetic conditions that run in the family or to select embryos that are free of specific genetic conditions to prevent the transmission of these conditions to the next generation.</li>
