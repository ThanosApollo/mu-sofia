* TODO General Microbiology
** 1.Introduction - History and Subject
*** History
+ Microbiology is the study of living organisms of microscopic size
  + The term was introduced by the French chemist *Louis Pasteur*, considered to be the 'Father of Microbiology'
+ For many years it was believed that the microorganisms arose from decomposed organic matter.
  + This was known as /theory of spontaneous generation/
+ Louis Pasteur generated strong evidence to show that the microorganisms did not arise /de novo/ in the media but were introduced from without
+ Showed that microorganisms were inactivated by boiling at 120C(autoclaved) and 170C
+ Pasteur demonstrations prompted *Joseph Lister's* work on wound sepsis
  + He introduced the practice of protecting wounds from airborne microbes by applying antiseptic dressing and making medical workers wash their hands with antiseptic solution before they touch a patient, achieving striking success at reducing mortality due to sepsis
+ Pasteur developed vaccines against chicken cholera and anthrax by using attenuated suspension of bacteria

*** Subject
+ Medical microbiology is the biological study of bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and large algae which are collectively called as microorganisms
  + Characteristics of Microscopic organisms :
    + *M* = Microscopic
    + *I* = Independent units
    + *C* = Complex -> less than plants and animals
    + *R* = Rapid growth rates
    + *O* = Omnipresent (present everywhere)
+ Medical microbiology is concerned with aetiology, pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis and treatment of infections, as well as with epidemiology and control of infection in a community
+ Branches of microbiology include :
  + Bacteriology : study of bacteria
  + Mycology : study of fungi, includes both microscopic forms(molds and yeasts) and larger forms(mushrooms)
  + Parasitology : Study of parasites
  + Virology : Study of viruses
  + Immunology : Study of body defenses that protect against infection
  + Microbial taxonomy : Study of classification, naming and identification of organisms
  + Biotechnology : Use of systems or process of organisms to arrive at a desired product
  + Genetic engineering : Involves techniques that deliberately alter genetic make-up of organisms to introduce new compounds/genetic combinations


** 2.Bacterial Taxonomy - Classification, Nomenclatures, Identification
*** Classification
+ Categorization of organisms into taxonomic groups
+ Requires experimental and observational techniques
  + Biochemical, physiologic, genetic and morphologic properties are necessary for a taxon description
*** Nomenclature
+ Naming of the organism by international rules, according to it's characteristics
  + First word(Genus) is always capitalized
  + Second word(Species) is not capitalized
    /e.g Escherichia Coli/
*** Identification
+ Practical use of classification scheme to:
  + Isolated and distinguish desirable organism
  + Verify the authenticity or special properties of a culture
  + *Isolated and identify causative agent of disease*

**** Taxonomic ranks
+ Form the basis for the organization of bacteria, Linnaean taxonomy uses formal taxonomic tanks.
| Formal Rank | Example                 |
|-------------+-------------------------|
| Kingdom     | Protista/Prokaryotes    |
| Division    | Gracilicutes            |
| Class       | Scotobacteria           |
| Order       | Eubacteriaceae          |
| Family      | Enterobacteriaceae      |
| Genus       | Escherichia             |
| Species     | Coli                    |
| Subtype     | Escherichia coli O157:7 |
|-------------+-------------------------|

+ /Traditionally, all living objects had been divided into plant and animal kingdom/
+ There are some organisms that do not fulfill criteria for either of the two kingdoms.
+ A new kingdom *Protista* was created to include these organisms. Protista has been divided into Viruses, Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes

** 3.Bacterial Morphology
*** Morphology and Shapes
+ Bacteria can have either of the three shapes
  + Cocci /e.g S.Aureus/
  + Bacilli(rods) /e.g Pseudomonas Aeruginosa/
    + Filaments :  long threads of bacilli which have not separated into single cells e.g Nocardia
    + Curved bacterial rods, e.g Vibrio cholerae
  + Spirillar/Spirochetes /e.g Borrelia/
+ When examined from outside, bacteria have :
  + *Surface adherents and appendages*
    + Capsule and Slime layer -> collectively called as glycocalyx
  + Cell wall
  + Cytoplasm
  + Nucleus
*** Cell wall / Gram stain
+ Chemically formed by N-acetyl glycosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid molecules alternating in chains, /which are cross linked by peptide chains/
+ Bacteria are classified as /gram positive/ or /gram negative/ depending on their cell wall characteristics
  + Violet stain is applied to bacteria, followed by a decolorizing agent and a red stain
  + Those who walls retain violet(blue) dye are Gram Positive
  + Those that appear red, not having retained the first dye are Gram-Negative

| *Gram Positive*                                            | *Gram Negative*                                                            |

|------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

+ Bacterial exceptions
  + Mycobacteria -> consist of mycolic acids
  + Chlamydia -> muramic acid
  + Mycoplasma -> No cell wall, incoporates sterols
** 6.Bacterial ultrastructure - external structures
+ *Capsules* - Glycocalyx
  + Some bacteria are closely surrounded by loose polysaccharide or protein layers called capsules
  + Functions of capsules:
    + Protein against phagocytosis
    + K-Antigen polysaccharides, protect from immune system
    + Promote adherance
+ Flagella
  + Aid motility
+ Pili
  + Adherence
  + Sex pili promotes conjugation -> plasmid transfer
** 7.Bacterial ultrastructure - spores
+ Bacterial endospores are the most resistant cells
+ Spore = dehydrated, multi-shelled structure, dormant
+ Formed when nutrients are limited
  + Allows bacteria to survive extreme conditions
  + Spores lack metabolic activity
  + Core contains dipicolinic acid -> responsible for heat resistance
+ Must autoclave to kill spores
+ Hydrogen peroxide and iodine based agents are also sporicidal

** 8.Bacterial Metabolism
+ Bacterial metabolism refers to biochemical reactions that occur within a bacterium
+ Bacterial can be further classified according to their metabolic process i.e how they deal with oxygen, how they deal with their carbon energy source as well as the end products they produce
+ Classification according to oxygen utilization
  + Obligate Aerobes
    + Cannot survive without oxygen
    + Require oxygen for growth
    + Use O2 as final e- acceptor in aerobic respiration
  + Obligate Anaerobes
    + Cannot survive in the presence of oxygen
    + Don't need O2 as nutrient
    + Survive by fermentation and anaerobic respiration
  + Facultative anaerobes
    + Prefer O2 but can grow without it
** 9.Bacterial growth and cell division
*** Bacterial growth requirments
+ Effects of pH
  + Acidophiles -> prefer acidic environments e.g mycobacteria
  + Neutrophils -> neutral pH
  + Alkaliphile -> alkaline environments e.g Vibrio cholerae
+ Effects of Temperature
  + Psychrophile -> prefer cold
  + Mesophile -> prefer 37C
  + Thermophile -> prefer hot > 45C
*** Bacterial Cell division
+ Grow and replicate by binary fission
+ Asexual type of cell division
  + two identical daughter cells are formed
** 10.Bacterial Genetics: DNA- the genetic material-structure, replication and function
+ Genetics is the science of hereditary and variability of organisms, including microorganisms
*** Genetic material-structure
+ Bacterial genome consists of :
  + Bacterial chromosome
  + Plasmids
  + Transpons
  + Integrons
+ *Bacterial chromosome*
  + A single circular haploid circular molecule
  + Bacterial DNA is *super-coiled* due to DNA gyrase
+ *Plasmids*
  + Extrachromosomal, non-essential, replicate independently of bacterial chromosome, smaller than chromosome
  + Carry genes for virulence factors or antibiotic resistance
+ *Transpons*
  + /known as jumping genes/
  + Transfer genes from one place to another or between different DNA molecules i.e plasmid -> chromosome
+ *Integrons*
  + Contains cassettes of resistance genes and together with transpons play important role in dissemination of antimicrobial resistance
*** Replication
+ Replication is initiated at Ori C
+ Helicase unwinds double helix -> replication fork
+ Primase synethesizes Primer
+ DNA polymerase synthesizes a copy of DNA in 5-3 direction, leading and lagging strands
+ DNA ligase 'glues' pieces of DNA on lagging strand
*** Function
+ Bacteria don't have any introns or exons
+ Genes are organized into operons
+ Operon = Genes that are *controlled by operator*
+ /e.g Lac Operon in E.Coli/
** 11.Bacterial Genetics : Mutation, recombination and DNA exchange
+ *Transformation*:
  + Competent bacteria can bind and import pieces of environmental naked bacterial DNA
+ *Conjugation*
  + Transfer of dna material using plasmids
+ *Transduction*
  + Generalized -> A *packaging* error. Lytic phage infects bacterium, leading to cleavage of bacterial DNA. Parts of bacterial chromosomal DNA may become packaged in phage capsid, phage infects another bacterium, transferring these genes
  + Speciliazed -> An *excision* event.
    + Lysogenic phage infects bacterium
    + Viral DNA incoporates into bacterial chromosome
    + When phage DNA is excised, bacterial genes may be excised with it
    + DNA is packaged into phage capsid and can infect another bacterium

* Bacteriology
** 31. Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
*** Specimens
+ A properly collected specimen is the single most important step in the diagnosis of an infection
+ The specimen must be obtained from the site most likely to yield the agent at that particular stage of illness and must be handled in such a way as to favor the agent's survival and growth
+ *A few general rules apply to all specimens:*
  1. Quantity of the material must be adequate
  2. Sample should be representative of the infectious process /e.g sputum, not saliva/
  3. Contamination of the specimen must be avoided by using *only sterile equipment and aseptic precautions.*
  4. Specimen must be taken to the laboratory and examined promptly, special transport media me be helpful
  5. Meaningful specimens to diagnose bacterial infections must be secured before antimicrobial drugs are administered
*** Microscopy and stains
+ Microscopic examination of stained or unstained specimens is relatively simple and inexpensive, but much less sensitive method
+ *Gram staining* is very useful procedure in diagnostic microbiology, /e.g gram positive cocci in clusters indicates staph infections/
+ *Acid-fast(Ziehl-Neelsen)* stain used for /e.g diagnosis of mycobacteria in laboratories that lack IF staining/
+ *Immunofluorescent antibody (IF) staining*
  + Fluorescein-labeled antibodies in common use are made from anti-sera produced by injecting animals with whole organisms
  + Most useful in confirming the presence of specific organisms /such as Bordetella pertussis,Legionella pneumophila/
*** Culture systems:
+ Standard medium is *blood agar* /most aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms will grow on blood agar/
+ *Chocolate agar*, is used to grow organisms that do not grow in blood agar such as /Haemophilus Influenza and Neisseria/
+ A selective medium for enteric gram negative rods such as /MacConkey agar/ is used routinely
+ Specialized media are commonly used in diagnostic bacteriology
  + the laboratory stuff selects the specific media on the basis of the information of the culture requires
  + /e.g freshly made Bordet-Gengou or charcoal containing medium is used for B.Pertussis/
*** Antigen detection
+ EIAs, including *ELISA* (/enzyme linked immunosorbent assays)/ and *agglutination tests* are used to detect antigens of infectious agents.
+ *EIAs format:*
  + One commonly used format is to bind a capture antibody, specific for the antigen in question, to the wells of plastic micro-dilution trays.
  + The specimen containing the antigen is incubated in the wells followed by washing of the wells.
  + A second antibody for the antigen, labeled with enzyme, is used to detect the antigen
  + Addition of the substrate for the enzyme allows detection of the bound antigen by colorimetric reaction
+ *Latent agglutination test format*
  + Directed ath the detection of the carbohydrate antigens of the encapsulated microorganisms
  + /Used for detection of group A streptococcal pharyngitis and cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients/
  + Not recommended for direct specimen testing due to low sensitivity
*** Western Blot
+ This method is based on electrophoretic separation of major proteins of the organism in two-dimensional agarose gel
+ Used as specific test for antibodies in HIV and Lyme disease
*** Molecular diagnostics
+ This method is based on the hybridization of a characterized nucleic acid probe to a specific nucleic acid sequence in a test specimen
+ followed by detection of the paired hybrid
+ /e.g single-stranded probe DNA(or RNA) is used to detect complementary RNA or denatured DNA in a test specimen/

** 32.Staphylococcus

** 62.Human microbial Flora (Natural flora) in health and disease. Iatrogenic influences on the normal human flora - dysbacteriosis as a side effect of antibiotic, cytostatic and immunosuppression therapy
*** Normal flora
+ /Normal flora: term used to describe various bacteria and fungi that are permanent residents of certain body sites, especially the skin, oropharynx, colon and vagina/
+ Normal flora organisms are usually referred to as commensals, which are organism that derive benefit from another host but don’t harm the host
+ Internal organs are usually sterile
+ /Carrier state : when an individual harbours a potential pathogen and ∴ can be a source of infection of others/ 
  + It is most frequently used when referring to a person w/an asymptomatic infection or someone who has recovered from a disease but continues to carry the organism and may shed it for a long period

+ The members of the normal flora play a role in both maintenance of health and causation of diseases in 3 significant ways:
  + They can cause disease, especially in immunocompromised and debilitated individuals. Although these organism are non-pathogenic in their usual location, they can be pathogens in other parts 
  + They constitute a protective host defence mechanism
    + The non-pathogenic resident bacteria occupy attachment sites on the skin and mucosa that can interfere w/colonisation by pathogenic bacteria
    + Colonisation resistance = ability of members of normal flora to limit the growth of pathogens
    + If normal flora is suppressed, pathogens may grow and cause disease – e.g. anti-B can ↓ normal flora and ∴ allow pathogenic bacteria, resistant to anti-B, to overgrow 
  + They may serve a nutritional function
    + Intestinal bacteria produce several B vitamins and vit K
    + Poorly nourished people who are treated w/oral anti-B may have vit deficiencies due to ↓ in normal flora
    + However, the normal flora isn’t essential for proper nutrition
*** Dysbacteriosis (dysbiosis)
/Definition: microbial imbalance of maladaptation on/inside the body/
+ It results from a deficiency of good bacteria or an overgrowth of harmful organisms
+ Probiotics are supplements for ‘good’ bacteria that are found naturally in the body. They keep ‘bad’ bacteria at bay and support functions such as digestion, vit production and immune balance 
+ Causes = repeated inappropriate anti-B exposure, alcohol misuse or inappropriate diet 
+ Treatment = faecal microbiota transplant, probiotics
*** The effects of antibiotics in the gut microbiota
+ Antibiotic administration can result in microbiota dysbiosis i.e. disturbance of composition and function. Broad-spectrum antibiotics can affect the bacteria in the gut community 
+ One of the most imminent threats of gut microbiota alterations is ↑ susceptibility of intestinal infections, which can stem from newly acquired pathogens or from the sudden overgrowth of opportunistic organisms already in the microbiota. Anti-B-associated diarrhoeas due to nosocomial pathogens are a frequent occurrence. In addition, they promote the spread of drug-resistant pathogens 
+ Recurrent infection with C. difficile occurs in hospitalized patients, particularly those undergoing antibiotic treatment.

** 83.Microbiological aspects of Central Nervous System Infections
The blood brain barrier excludes almost all microorganisms, meaning there is no natural microbiological flora. This does however also mean there are no immune cells and antibodies, so there is greater risk if an infection does get into the brain.
To do this simply the major infections and etiological factors of the CNS are:
+ Meningitis
  + Caused by haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria meningitidis
+ Brain abscesses
  + Often exhibit mixed flora of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria
+ Encephalitis
  + Many viruses, herpes simplex and arboviruses are major causes of fatal form
+ Spirochetes and Retroviruses can all cause chronic CNS conditions.
/A more detailed breakdown of CNS infections is below/
+ Bacterial
  + Tuberculosis (m. tuberculosis and others)
  + Leprosy (m. leprae)
  + Neurosyphilis (treponema pallidum)
  + Bacterial meningitis (commonly Neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus
  pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B)
  + Late stage lyme disease (Borrelia)
  + Brain abscess (commonly staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus intermedius
  and pseudomonas species)
  + Neuroborreliosis (Borrelia)
+ Viral
  + Viral meningitis (mostly caused by enteroviruses)
  + Eastern equine encephalitis (eastern equine virus)
  + St Louis encephalitis (St louis encephalitis virus)
  + Japanese encephalitis (Japanese encephalitis virus)

* Practical Examination
** 1. Microscopic Principles and Applications
Microscope contains:
- Objective lens
- Ocular lens
- Lens tube
- Stage
- And reflector
The magnification of the microscope is the produce of the objective and ocular lens
magnification. Resolution is the microscope's ability to identify to light spots separately, and
the shortest distance between features that can be identified. In effect, resolution determines
how clearly something is seen. The highest theoretical resolution is 100 to 200 nm due to
effect of wavelength.
All lenses also have a numerical aperture which illustrates the resolution and brightness of
the lens.
Microbes (the subject of microbiology) are microscopic, that is to say, smaller than a human
eye can see, as such we must magnify. On average, microbes tend to be 1/10th the size of a
typical human cell.
** 2. Loeffler's stain
Loeffler's stain, also known as Loeffler's methylene blue, is a laboratory staining technique used to identify the presence of certain types of bacteria in a sample. It is commonly used to identify the presence of the bacteria that cause diphtheria, a serious respiratory illness.

To perform Loeffler's stain, a sample of bacteria is first collected and placed onto a microscope slide. The slide is then flooded with a solution of Loeffler's methylene blue, which is a combination of methylene blue and eosin dyes. The bacteria in the sample absorb the dye, allowing them to be visualized under a microscope.

Loeffler's stain is particularly useful for identifying the presence of the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which is the cause of diphtheria. The bacterium appears as small, irregularly shaped cells with a characteristic "Chinese letter" appearance when viewed under a microscope after staining with Loeffler's stain.

Overall, Loeffler's stain is a useful tool for identifying the presence of certain types of bacteria in a sample and can be an important tool in the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections.

** 3. Gram stain  - preparation, observation and interpretation.

Gram stain is a laboratory technique used to differentiate between different types of bacteria based on their cell wall structure. It is one of the most widely used techniques for identifying bacteria and is often the first step in the identification process.

To prepare a sample for Gram stain, a small sample of bacteria is collected and spread onto a microscope slide. The sample is then fixed to the slide by heating it to a high temperature. Once the sample is fixed, it is treated with crystal violet, a violet-colored dye that is absorbed by the bacterial cells. The sample is then washed with a decolorizing solution, which removes the dye from some of the cells. Finally, the sample is treated with a counterstain called safranin, which colors the remaining cells.

To observe the results of the Gram stain, the slide is examined under a microscope. The different types of bacteria will appear in different colors based on their ability to retain the crystal violet dye. Gram-positive bacteria, which have a thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, will appear violet or purple under the microscope. Gram-negative bacteria, which have a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane, will appear pink or red due to the safranin counterstain.

To interpret the results of a Gram stain, the appearance of the bacterial cells is used to classify them as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative. The results of the Gram stain can then be used to guide further identification and characterization of the bacteria.

** 4. Neisser stain – preparation, observation and interpretation.
Neisser stain, also known as Neisser-Weigert stain or Weigert-Neisser stain, is a laboratory technique used to identify the presence of certain types of bacteria in a sample. It is often used to detect the presence of bacteria in tissue samples and to differentiate between different types of bacteria based on their cell wall structure.

To prepare a sample for Neisser stain, a small sample of bacteria is collected and spread onto a microscope slide. The sample is then fixed to the slide by heating it to a high temperature. Once the sample is fixed, it is treated with a combination of fuchsin and acid alcohol, which stains the bacterial cells. The sample is then washed with water to remove excess dye.

To observe the results of the Neisser stain, the slide is examined under a microscope. The different types of bacteria will appear in different colors based on their ability to retain the fuchsin dye. Gram-positive bacteria, which have a thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, will appear red or pink under the microscope. Gram-negative bacteria, which have a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane, will appear blue due to the counterstain.

To interpret the results of a Neisser stain, the appearance of the bacterial cells is used to classify them as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative. The results of the Neisser stain can then be used to guide further identification and characterization of the bacteria.
** 5. Smear preparation and staining by Ziehl – Neelsen method. Technique, observation and examination of the preparations.
The Ziehl-Neelsen method, also known as the acid-fast stain, is a laboratory technique used to identify the presence of certain types of bacteria in a sample. It is often used to detect the presence of acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in tissue samples.

To prepare a sample for the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, a small sample of bacteria is collected and spread onto a microscope slide to create a smear. The smear is then fixed to the slide by heating it to a high temperature. Once the smear is fixed, it is treated with a combination of carbol fuchsin and acid alcohol, which stains the bacterial cells. The smear is then washed with water to remove excess dye.

To observe the results of the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, the slide is examined under a microscope. The acid-fast bacteria will appear red or pink under the microscope due to the retention of the carbol fuchsin dye. Non-acid-fast bacteria will appear colorless.

To examine the preparations, the number and distribution of acid-fast bacteria in the sample can be counted and evaluated. The results of the Ziehl-Neelsen stain can then be used to guide further identification and characterization of the bacteria.
** 6. Smear preparation and staining by Peshkov method. Technique, observation and examination of the preparations.
Some gram+ bacteria of the genera Bacillus and Clostridium are spore – formers. Under
unfavorable environmental conditions, they can convert from a vegetative to a dormant state
(spore). Endospores strongly resist staining by simple dyes until they germinate (dormant
endospores, once stained, are resistant to decolonization).
+ Take a part of an isolated colony of B. cereus on the surface of the medium with a loop and
spread on slide
+ Air dry, and heat fix the smear on a glass slide
+ Flood the smear with methylene blue (Loeffer formula)

There are several quantitative methods that can be used to determine the growth of bacteria in a laboratory setting. These methods involve the measurement of the number of bacteria present in a sample and can be used to assess the growth of bacteria over time or to compare the growth of different bacterial populations.

One method for the determination of bacterial growth is enumeration with an optical standard. This method involves the use of a standard curve to convert the optical density of a bacterial culture to the number of bacteria present in the culture. The optical density of a bacterial culture is determined using a spectrophotometer, which measures the absorbance of light by the bacteria. The standard curve is created by preparing a series of known bacterial concentrations and measuring their absorbance. The optical density of the unknown bacterial culture is then plotted on the standard curve to determine the number of bacteria present.

Another method for the determination of bacterial growth is the determination of the microbial count on a solid medium. This method involves the plating of a known volume of a bacterial culture onto a solid culture medium and the incubation of the plates to allow the bacteria to grow. The resulting bacterial colonies are then counted to determine the number of bacteria present in the original culture.

The serial dilution method is a laboratory technique that is used to determine the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. This method involves the creation of a series of progressively diluted bacterial cultures that are used to test the effectiveness of different concentrations of an antimicrobial agent.

To perform the serial dilution method, a known volume of a bacterial culture is diluted in a series of tubes or wells containing a liquid or solid growth medium. The concentration of bacteria in each tube or well is then determined, typically by measuring the optical density of the culture or by counting the number of colonies on a solid culture medium. The tubes or wells are then incubated to allow the bacteria to grow.

After incubation, a known volume of an antimicrobial agent is added to each tube or well at different concentrations. The tubes or wells are then incubated again to allow the bacteria to grow in the presence of the antimicrobial agent. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antimicrobial agent is then determined by examining the tubes or wells for the presence of bacterial growth. The MIC is the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial agent that prevents the growth of the bacteria.

The serial dilution method is an important tool for the determination of antimicrobial susceptibility and can provide valuable information about the effectiveness of different antimicrobial agents against different types of bacteria. It is widely used in research and clinical settings to guide the selection of appropriate treatment options and to monitor the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
** 17. Antibiotics and chemotherapeutics – characteristics and usage
Antibiotics and chemotherapeutics are medications that are used to treat bacterial infections and other diseases. They work by inhibiting or killing the growth of bacteria or other microorganisms.

There are several characteristics that differentiate antibiotics and chemotherapeutics from each other. Antibiotics are medications that are specifically designed to inhibit or kill bacteria. They are typically derived from natural sources, such as fungi or bacteria, and work by targeting specific bacterial mechanisms, such as cell wall synthesis or protein synthesis. Antibiotics are typically used to treat bacterial infections, but they may also be used to prevent the growth of bacteria in certain situations, such as after surgery or during chemotherapy.

Chemotherapeutics are medications that are used to treat cancer or other diseases that are caused by the growth and proliferation of abnormal cells. They work by inhibiting or killing the growth of these cells. Chemotherapeutics may be used alone or in combination with other medications and are typically administered through injection or oral ingestion. They may be derived from natural sources or synthesized in a laboratory and can target specific cell processes, such as DNA synthesis or protein synthesis.

The usage of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics is carefully regulated to ensure their safe and effective use. They are typically prescribed by a healthcare provider and should be used according to the prescribed dosage and duration. It is important to follow the instructions for taking these medications to ensure their effectiveness and to minimize the risk of side effects. Overuse or improper use of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics can lead to the development of resistance, which can reduce their effectiveness and may require the use of more potent or toxic medications.
** 18. Disk Diffusion Method for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing – antibiogram (NCCLS method)
The disk diffusion method, also known as the Kirby-Bauer test or the antibiogram, is a laboratory technique used to determine the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. This method is based on the diffusion of an antimicrobial agent from a paper disk impregnated with the agent into a culture of bacteria on a solid culture medium. The diameter of the zone of inhibition around the disk, which is the area in which the bacteria are inhibited or killed by the antimicrobial agent, is used to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria to the agent.

The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) has established guidelines for the interpretation of the results of the disk diffusion method, which are used to classify the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. According to these guidelines, the presence of a zone of inhibition around the disk with a diameter of greater than or equal to a specified value indicates that the bacteria are susceptible to the antimicrobial agent. The absence of a zone of inhibition or a zone of inhibition with a diameter less than the specified value indicates that the bacteria are resistant to the antimicrobial agent.

To perform the disk diffusion method using the NCCLS guidelines, a known volume of a bacterial culture is plated onto a solid culture medium and allowed to grow to form a lawn of bacteria. A paper disk impregnated with an antimicrobial agent is then placed on the surface of the culture medium. The culture medium is incubated to allow the diffusion of the antimicrobial agent from the disk into the culture. The diameter of the zone of inhibition around the disk is then measured and compared to the NCCLS guidelines to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria to the antimicrobial agent.

The disk diffusion method is a widely used technique for the determination of antimicrobial susceptibility and is useful for the rapid screening of large numbers of bacterial isolates.

There are several principles and techniques that are used in serological diagnosis. One principle is the use of antigens, which are substances that stimulate the production of antibodies and can be used to detect the presence of specific antibodies. Antigens can be derived from microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, or from other sources, such as synthetic peptides or proteins.

There are several techniques that are used to detect and measure antibodies in serological diagnosis, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and western blot. These techniques involve the use of labeled antibodies or other reagents to detect the presence and concentration of specific antibodies in a patient's blood sample.

Serological diagnosis is used in a variety of medical settings to diagnose infectious diseases and to monitor the immune response to infections or other stimuli. It is a useful tool for the detection and identification of microorganisms and can provide valuable information about the prevalence and distribution of infectious diseases in a population. Serological diagnosis is also used in research to study the immune response to infections and to develop vaccines and other immunotherapies.
** 22. Slide agglutination (direct  agglutination): principle, technique and reading of the results.
Slide agglutination, also known as direct agglutination, is a laboratory technique used to identify the presence of specific antibodies or antigens in a sample. It is a relatively simple and rapid method that can be used to diagnose infections or to determine blood types.

The principle behind slide agglutination is that when specific antibodies are mixed with their corresponding antigens, they will form visible clumps or agglutinates. This occurs because the antibodies bind to the antigens, causing them to clump together.

To perform slide agglutination, a small amount of the sample is mixed with a known quantity of the specific antigen or antibody. The mixture is then placed onto a microscope slide and observed under a microscope. If the sample contains the corresponding antibody or antigen, visible clumps or agglutinates will form.

There are several factors that can affect the results of slide agglutination, including the type and concentration of the antigen or antibody, the presence of other substances in the sample, and the conditions under which the test is performed.

To read the results of a slide agglutination test, the technician looks for the presence or absence of agglutinates. If agglutinates are present, it indicates that the sample contains the corresponding antibody or antigen. If no agglutinates are present, it indicates that the sample does not contain the specific antibody or antigen.
** 23. Widal’s serodiagnosis (tube agglutination method) using a patient’s serum and Salmonella antigens 0:9,12 and H:2. Principle,technique and reading of the results.
Widal's serodiagnosis is a laboratory technique that is used to diagnose typhoid fever, a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. This technique is based on the detection of antibodies in a patient's blood that are produced in response to the infection.

The Widal's serodiagnosis method uses a tube agglutination technique, in which a patient's blood sample is mixed with Salmonella antigens and observed for the presence of agglutination, or clumping of the cells. The antigens used in this technique are specific to S. Typhi and include O antigens (0:9,12) and H antigens (H:2). The presence of agglutination indicates the presence of antibodies in the patient's blood that are specific to these antigens and is indicative of a current or past infection with S. Typhi.

To perform Widal's serodiagnosis, a small volume of a patient's blood is collected and mixed with the Salmonella antigens in a tube. The tube is then incubated and observed for the presence of agglutination. The degree of agglutination is typically measured by comparing the tube to a standard agglutination scale. The presence of a weak or moderate level of agglutination is typically considered to be indicative of a current or past infection with S. Typhi, while a strong level of agglutination is typically considered to be indicative of a current infection.

Widal's serodiagnosis is a useful tool for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, but it has some limitations. It may not be sensitive enough to detect all cases of typhoid fever, and it may produce false positive results in patients who have been vaccinated against S. Typhi or who have been infected with other types of Salmonella. As a result, Widal's serodiagnosis is typically used in conjunction with
** 24. Passive hemagglutination, coagglutination, latex agglutination. Principle, technique and reading of the results.
Passive hemagglutination is a laboratory technique used to identify the presence of specific antibodies or antigens in a sample. It is similar to slide agglutination, but instead of being performed on a microscope slide, the reaction occurs in a tube or well.

The principle behind passive hemagglutination is the same as slide agglutination: specific antibodies will form visible clumps or agglutinates when mixed with their corresponding antigens.

To perform passive hemagglutination, a small amount of the sample is mixed with a known quantity of the specific antigen or antibody and a suspension of red blood cells. The mixture is then incubated for a period of time and observed for the formation of agglutinates. If the sample contains the corresponding antibody or antigen, the red blood cells will clump together, forming visible agglutinates.

Coagglutination is a variation of passive hemagglutination in which the reaction is performed on a microscope slide rather than in a tube or well. The principle and technique are the same as passive hemagglutination, but the reaction is observed under a microscope rather than by eye.

Latex agglutination is a laboratory technique similar to passive hemagglutination, but instead of using red blood cells, it uses latex particles that have been coated with the specific antigen or antibody. The principle and technique are the same as passive hemagglutination, but the reaction is observed for the formation of agglutinates of latex particles rather than red blood cells.

To read the results of passive hemagglutination, coagglutination, or latex agglutination, the technician looks for the presence or absence of agglutinates. If agglutinates are present, it indicates that the sample contains the corresponding antibody or antigen. If no agglutinates are present, it indicates that the sample does not contain the specific antibody or antigen.
** 25. Ring precipitation test (thermoprecipitation ). Principle, technique and reading of the results.
The ring precipitation test, also known as the thermoprecipitation test or the heat-precipitation test, is a laboratory technique that is used to detect the presence of antibodies in a patient's blood. This technique is based on the principle that the addition of heat to a mixture of antigens and antibodies can cause the precipitation, or clumping, of the antibodies, which can be observed as a ring around the edge of the test tube.

To perform the ring precipitation test, a small volume of a patient's blood is collected and mixed with a known quantity of antigens in a test tube. The test tube is then placed in a water bath and heated to a specific temperature for a specific period of time. After heating, the test tube is removed from the water bath and observed for the presence of a ring of precipitated antibodies around the edge of the tube. The presence of a ring indicates the presence of antibodies in the patient's blood that are specific to the antigens used in the test.

The ring precipitation test is a simple and rapid technique that can be used to detect the presence of antibodies in a patient's blood. It is particularly useful for the detection of antibodies to infectious agents, such as bacteria or viruses, and can provide valuable information about the immune status of a patient. However, the ring precipitation test has some limitations, including the possibility of false positive or false negative results, and it is typically used in conjunction with other laboratory tests to confirm the presence of antibodies.
** 26. Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion (DID). Radial single immunodiffusion. Immunoelectrophoresis. Principle, application, reading of the results.
Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion (DID) is a method used to identify and quantify proteins or antigens in a sample. It is based on the principle of immunodiffusion, which is the movement of proteins or antigens through a gel matrix in response to an applied force, such as an electrical field or concentration gradient.

In DID, the sample is placed in the center of a gel matrix, and a known protein or antigen is placed in a circular pattern around it. The proteins or antigens diffuse through the gel matrix, and if they are immunologically similar, they will form a precipitation line at the point of contact. The distance between the center and the precipitation line is proportional to the concentration of the protein or antigen in the sample.

Radial single immunodiffusion (RSID) is a similar method, but it uses a single protein or antigen in a radial pattern around the sample, rather than two proteins or antigens in a circular pattern. RSID is typically used to quantify a single protein or antigen in a sample.

Immunoelectrophoresis is a method used to separate and identify proteins or antigens in a sample based on their size, charge, and immunological properties. It involves applying an electrical field to a sample in a gel matrix, which causes the proteins or antigens to move towards the opposite charge. The resulting pattern can be used to identify and quantify the proteins or antigens in the sample.

To read the results of immunodiffusion or immunoelectrophoresis, the gel matrix is typically stained with a dye that binds to the proteins or antigens. The resulting pattern can be compared to known standards to identify and quantify the proteins or antigens in the sample.
** 27. Titration of hemolytic serum – application, principle, technique and reading of the results.
The titration of hemolytic serum is a laboratory technique that is used to determine the concentration of a substance in a solution that is capable of causing the lysis, or destruction, of red blood cells (RBCs). This technique is commonly used to determine the concentration of hemolysins, which are substances that are produced by bacteria and can cause the lysis of RBCs.

To perform the titration of hemolytic serum, a known volume of the serum being tested is mixed with a known volume of a suspension of RBCs in a test tube. The test tube is then incubated at a specific temperature for a specific period of time. After incubation, the test tube is observed for the presence of lysis of the RBCs, which can be observed as a clearing of the suspension or the release of hemoglobin from the RBCs.

The titration of hemolytic serum is a useful tool for the detection and measurement of hemolysins and can provide valuable information about the ability of a bacterial strain to produce these substances. It is commonly used in medical and research settings to study the pathogenic potential of bacterial strains and to develop strategies for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections.

To read the results of the titration of hemolytic serum, the concentration of the substance being tested is typically determined by comparing the test tube to a standard curve or by using a formula to calculate the concentration based on the volume of the serum and the volume of the RBC suspension. The concentration of the substance is typically reported in units of hemolytic activity, such as hemolytic units (HUs) or hemolytic titer.
** 28. Complement fixation reaction for diagnosis of syphilis: Wassermann’s reaction. Application, principle, reading of the results.
The Wassermann reaction, also known as the complement fixation reaction, is a laboratory test used to diagnose syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. The test is named after its developer, August Paul von Wassermann.

The principle of the Wassermann reaction is based on the ability of T. pallidum to elicit a specific immune response in infected individuals, resulting in the production of antibodies against the bacterium. These antibodies can be detected in the blood using a laboratory test.

To perform the Wassermann reaction, a sample of the patient's blood is mixed with a solution containing T. pallidum antigens. If the patient has been infected with T. pallidum and has produced antibodies against the bacterium, the antibodies will bind to the antigens in the solution, forming a complex. This complex will then trigger the complement system, a group of proteins that play a role in the immune response, resulting in the production of a substance called complement. The presence of complement can be detected using a reagent, which will cause the solution to turn a specific color.

To read the results of the Wassermann reaction, the solution is examined for the presence of the specific color change that indicates the presence of complement. A positive result, indicated by the presence of the color change, suggests that the patient has produced antibodies against T. pallidum and may be infected with syphilis. A negative result, indicated by the absence of the color change, suggests that the patient has not produced antibodies against T. pallidum and is not infected with syphilis.

It is important to note that the Wassermann reaction is not a definitive test for syphilis, and a positive result should be confirmed using additional tests.
** 29. ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) – basic principle, reading and interpretation of results, application. Immunofluorescence – direct and indirect immunofluorescence, application.
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a laboratory test that is used to detect the presence of specific proteins or antibodies in a sample. It is based on the principle of antigen-antibody binding, in which antibodies produced by the body in response to a specific antigen will bind to that antigen when it is present in the body.

To perform an ELISA, a sample is placed in a well on a flat plate, and a specific antigen is added to the sample. If the sample contains antibodies that bind to the antigen, they will be captured in the well. A second antibody, called a detection antibody, is then added to the well. This detection antibody is linked to an enzyme, which will produce a specific chemical reaction when the antigen-antibody complex is present. This chemical reaction can be detected using a reagent, which will cause the solution in the well to change color.

To read the results of an ELISA, the solution in the well is examined for the presence of the specific color change that indicates the presence of the antigen-antibody complex. A positive result, indicated by the presence of the color change, suggests that the sample contains the specific antigen or antibodies being tested for. A negative result, indicated by the absence of the color change, suggests that the sample does not contain the specific antigen or antibodies being tested for.

ELISAs are used in a variety of applications, including the diagnosis of infectious diseases, the detection of allergies, and the measurement of hormone levels.

Immunofluorescence is a laboratory technique that is used to visualize specific proteins or antibodies in a sample. It is based on the principle of fluorescence, in which a substance absorbs light at one wavelength and reemits it at a longer wavelength, resulting in a visible color change.

There are two types of immunofluorescence: direct immunofluorescence and indirect immunofluorescence.

In direct immunofluorescence, a sample is placed on a microscope slide and a specific antibody that is labeled with a fluorescent dye is added to the sample. If the sample contains the specific protein or antigen being tested for, the labeled antibody will bind to it, resulting in fluorescence that can be visualized using a microscope.

In indirect immunofluorescence, a sample is placed on a microscope slide and a specific primary antibody is added to the sample. If the sample contains the specific protein or antigen being tested for, the primary antibody will bind to it. A secondary antibody, which is labeled with a fluorescent dye, is then added to the sample. This secondary antibody is directed against the primary antibody, and will bind to it if it is present in the sample. This results in fluorescence that can be visualized using a microscope.

Immunofluorescence is used in a variety of applications, including the detection and identification of specific proteins or antibodies in a sample, the localization of proteins or antibodies within cells or tissues, and the study of protein-protein interactions.
** 30. Antibacterial vaccines - characterization, application.
Antibacterial vaccines are vaccines that are used to prevent infection by bacteria. They work by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against specific bacterial antigens, which are proteins or other molecules that are unique to the bacteria. When a person is exposed to the bacteria later, their immune system is able to recognize and attack the bacteria, preventing or reducing the severity of the infection.

There are two main types of antibacterial vaccines: inactivated vaccines and live attenuated vaccines. Inactivated vaccines contain dead bacteria, which are not capable of causing infection but are still able to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies. Live attenuated vaccines contain live bacteria that have been genetically modified or treated in some way to make them less virulent, so that they are able to replicate in the body but do not cause severe disease.

Antibacterial vaccines are used to prevent a variety of bacterial infections, including pneumonia, meningitis, and tuberculosis. They are typically given to people who are at high risk of contracting the infection, such as those with compromised immune systems, travelers to areas where the infection is prevalent, and healthcare workers.

Characterization of antibacterial vaccines includes the identification and characterization of the specific bacterial antigens that the vaccine targets, as well as testing to determine the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. This may involve laboratory testing using cell culture or animal models, as well as clinical trials involving human subjects.
** 31. Antiviral vaccines – characterization, application.
Antiviral vaccines are vaccines that are used to prevent the transmission and infection of viruses. They work by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies that can recognize and neutralize the virus.

There are several different types of antiviral vaccines, including:

+ Live attenuated vaccines: These vaccines contain a live but weakened form of the virus. They are able to stimulate a strong immune response, but are generally not recommended for people with compromised immune systems.

+ Inactivated vaccines: These vaccines contain a killed form of the virus. They are not able to replicate or cause infection, but can still stimulate an immune response.

+ Subunit vaccines: These vaccines contain only specific parts of the virus, such as proteins or antigens, rather than the entire virus. They are generally safer than live or inactivated vaccines, but may not stimulate as strong of an immune response.

+ Recombinant vector vaccines: These vaccines use a different virus or bacteria to deliver genetic material from the target virus to the body. The body's immune system recognizes this genetic material as foreign and produces an immune response against it.

/Antiviral vaccines are used to prevent a wide range of viral infections, including influenza, hepatitis, herpes, and HIV. They are an important tool in controlling the spread of infectious diseases and reducing morbidity and mortality from viral infections./
** 32. Immune sera - characterization, application.
Immune sera, also known as immunoglobulin or antibodies, are proteins produced by the body's immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance, such as a virus or bacteria. They are produced by certain white blood cells called B-lymphocytes, and are designed to specifically recognize and neutralize the foreign substance.

There are several different types of immune sera, including:

+ IgG: This is the most common type of immunoglobulin, and is found in all body fluids. It is effective at neutralizing bacterial toxins and viruses, and is important for protecting against infections.

+ IgA: This type of immunoglobulin is found in mucous membranes, such as those in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. It helps to protect against infections by trapping and neutralizing pathogens before they can enter the body.

+ IgM: This is the first type of immunoglobulin produced in response to an infection or immunization. It is effective at neutralizing viruses and toxins, and is important for initiating the immune response.

+ IgE: This type of immunoglobulin is involved in allergies and parasites. It is responsible for the release of histamine and other chemicals in response to allergens, which can cause allergic symptoms.

/Immune sera can be collected from individuals who have recovered from an infection or have been vaccinated against a specific disease. They can then be purified and used to treat individuals who are infected with the same pathogen. This is known as passive immunity, as the recipient is receiving pre-made antibodies rather than producing their own. Immune sera are also used to create antiviral vaccines, as they can be used to identify the specific proteins or antigens that the immune system uses to recognize and neutralize the virus./
** 33. Immunomodulators (immunostimulators) - characterization, application.Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
Immunomodulators, also known as immunostimulators, are substances that modulate or alter the immune system. They can either stimulate or suppress the immune response, depending on the specific substance and the context in which it is used.

There are several different types of immunomodulators, including:

+ Immunostimulators: These substances stimulate the immune system and increase its activity. They are often used to treat immune deficiencies or to boost the immune system in people with chronic infections or cancer. Examples of immunostimulators include interferons, interleukins, and certain vaccines.

+ Immunosuppressants: These substances suppress the immune system and decrease its activity. They are often used to treat autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, or to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs. Examples of immunosuppressants include corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine.

Immunomodulators are used for a wide range of medical conditions, including infections, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and transplantation. They are an important tool in the treatment and management of these conditions, but can also have side effects, such as an increased risk of infections or malignancies.

As for laboratory diagnosis of bacterial diseases, there are several techniques that can be used to identify the presence and type of bacteria in a sample. These techniques include:

+ Microscopy: This involves examining the sample under a microscope to look for the presence of bacteria. Different types of bacteria have distinctive shapes and features that can be used to identify them.

+ Culture: This involves growing the bacteria on a specific medium in a laboratory setting. The bacteria will multiply and form colonies, which can then be identified based on their appearance, shape, and other characteristics.

+ Biochemical tests: These tests involve using specific reagents to detect the presence of certain enzymes or metabolic pathways that are characteristic of particular types of bacteria.

+ Molecular techniques: These techniques involve using DNA or RNA-based methods to identify and characterize bacteria. Examples include PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and sequencing.

/By using a combination of these techniques, it is possible to accurately identify and characterize bacterial infections. This is important for identifying the appropriate treatment and for tracking the spread of infectious diseases./

** 34. Laboratory Diagnosis of bacterial diseases: principles
Laboratory diagnosis of bacterial diseases involves the use of various techniques to identify the presence and identify the specific type of bacteria causing an infection. Here are some general principles that are commonly followed in the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial diseases:

+ Specimen collection: A suitable specimen is collected from the site of infection, such as a blood sample for bacterial blood infections or a throat swab for a throat infection. Proper collection and handling of the specimen are important to prevent contamination and ensure accurate results.

+ Isolation and cultivation of bacteria: The specimen is then plated onto nutrient media to allow the bacteria to grow and be isolated. Different media may be used to support the growth of different types of bacteria.

+ Identification of the bacteria: Once the bacteria have been isolated and cultivated, various techniques can be used to identify the specific type of bacteria present. These may include biochemical tests, serological tests, and molecular techniques such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction).

+ Antimicrobial susceptibility testing: This involves testing the sensitivity of the isolated bacteria to different antibiotics to determine the most appropriate treatment for the infection.

+ Reporting and interpretation of results: The results of the laboratory tests are then reported to the clinician, who interprets the results and uses them to guide treatment decisions.
** 35. Biochemical identification of the organisms of Fam. Enterobacteriaceae. Tests for identification.
There are several biochemical tests that can be used to identify the organisms of the family Enterobacteriaceae, which include well-known bacterial genera such as Escherichia, Salmonella, and Shigella. These tests take advantage of the unique metabolic properties of these bacteria to identify them. Some common biochemical tests used for the identification of Enterobacteriaceae include:

+ Oxidase test: This test is used to identify bacteria that produce the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Many, but not all, Enterobacteriaceae are positive for this test.

+ Indole test: This test is used to identify bacteria that can produce the compound indole from the amino acid tryptophan. Many Enterobacteriaceae are positive for this test.

+ Methyl red test: This test is used to identify bacteria that produce mixed acids during glucose fermentation. Many Enterobacteriaceae are positive for this test.

+ Voges-Proskauer test: This test is used to identify bacteria that produce acetylmethylcarbinol during glucose fermentation. Many Enterobacteriaceae are positive for this test.

+ Citrate utilization test: This test is used to identify bacteria that can utilize citrate as a sole carbon source. Some Enterobacteriaceae are positive for this test.

+ Urease test: This test is used to identify bacteria that produce the enzyme urease, which breaks down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. Some Enterobacteriaceae are positive for this test.

/Other biochemical tests and combinations of tests may also be used for the identification of Enterobacteriaceae. It is important to note that the results of these tests should be interpreted in conjunction with other identifying characteristics, such as colony morphology and gram stain results./
** 36. Tests for detection and pathogenicity of Staphylococcus spp. – reading and interpretation of results.
Staphylococcus spp. are Gram-positive, spherical bacteria that are commonly found on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and animals. Some strains of Staphylococcus spp. can cause infections, and it is important to be able to identify and differentiate pathogenic from non-pathogenic strains. Here are some tests that can be used for the detection and pathogenicity of Staphylococcus spp.:

+ Gram stain: This is a basic laboratory technique that is used to differentiate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus spp. are Gram-positive, which means they will appear purple or blue after being stained with crystal violet and iodine and decolorized with alcohol.

+ Culture and colony morphology: Staphylococcus spp. can be grown on nutrient media in the laboratory, and the appearance of the colonies can be used to identify the species. Pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus, for example, typically produce golden-yellow colonies on blood agar plates.

+ Coagulase test: This test is used to identify the presence of the enzyme coagulase, which is produced by some strains of Staphylococcus aureus. A positive result for this test indicates that the strain may be pathogenic.

+ Catalase test: This test is used to identify the presence of the enzyme catalase, which is produced by most strains of Staphylococcus spp. A positive result for this test indicates that the strain is likely a member of the Staphylococcus genus.

+ Biochemical tests: There are various biochemical tests that can be used to identify and differentiate between different species of Staphylococcus spp. These may include tests for glucose fermentation, lactose fermentation, and production of enzymes such as urease and coagulase.

/It is important to note that the results of these tests should be interpreted in conjunction with each other and with other identifying characteristics, such as growth on specific media and colony morphology./

** 37. Tests for identification of Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp.
Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. are Gram-positive, spherical bacteria that are commonly found in the human and animal respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Here are some tests that can be used for the identification of these bacteria:

+ Gram stain: This is a basic laboratory technique that is used to differentiate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. are Gram-positive, which means they will appear purple or blue after being stained with crystal violet and iodine and decolorized with alcohol.

+ Culture and colony morphology: Both Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. can be grown on nutrient media in the laboratory, and the appearance of the colonies can be used to identify the species. Streptococcus spp. tend to produce small, round, opaque colonies, while Enterococcus spp. tend to produce larger, more irregularly shaped colonies.

+ Catalase test: This test is used to identify the presence of the enzyme catalase, which is produced by most bacteria except for Streptococcus spp. and some Enterococcus spp. A negative result for this test is consistent with the identification of a Streptococcus or Enterococcus species.

+ Hemolysis: Some strains of Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. produce enzymes that can break down red blood cells, resulting in a zone of hemolysis (clear zone) around the colonies on blood agar plates. The type and size of the zone of hemolysis can be used to differentiate between different species of these bacteria.

+ Biochemical tests: There are various biochemical tests that can be used to identify and differentiate between different species of Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. These may include tests for glucose fermentation, lactose fermentation, and production of enzymes such as Lancefield's group-specific carbohydrate.

/It is important to note that the results of these tests should be interpreted in conjunction with each other and with other identifying characteristics, such as growth on specific media and colony morphology./
** 38. Laboratory diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract infections. Specimen collection, transport, microbial isolation and identification, antigen or antibody detection, expected causative agents, interpretation.
Gastrointestinal tract infections are caused by a wide variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens, and the laboratory diagnosis of these infections involves several steps. Here is a general overview of the process:

+ Specimen collection: Suitable specimens for the laboratory diagnosis of gastrointestinal infections may include stool, vomit, and swabs of the rectum or throat. Proper collection and handling of the specimen are important to prevent contamination and ensure accurate results.

+ Transport of the specimen: The specimen should be transported to the laboratory as soon as possible after collection, and appropriate precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of infection. The specimen may be placed in a special transport media to preserve the viability of the pathogens.

+ Microbial isolation and identification: The specimen is then plated onto nutrient media to allow any pathogens present to grow and be isolated. Different media may be used to support the growth of different types of bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Once the pathogens have been isolated, various techniques can be used to identify them, such as biochemical tests, serological tests, and molecular techniques such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction).

+ Antigen or antibody detection: In some cases, it may be possible to detect the presence of specific pathogens by detecting their antigens (proteins) or the antibodies (proteins produced by the immune system in response to the pathogen) in the specimen. These tests may be performed using rapid diagnostic assays or ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).

+ Expected causative agents: The types of pathogens that may cause gastrointestinal infections can vary depending on the location and circumstances of the infection. For example, infections of the upper gastrointestinal tract (such as food poisoning) may be caused by bacteria such as Salmonella or Shigella, while infections of the lower gastrointestinal tract (such as diarrhea) may be caused by bacteria such as Escherichia coli or viruses such as rotavirus.

+ Interpretation of results: The results of the laboratory tests are then reported to the clinician, who interprets the results and uses them to guide treatment decisions. It is important to note that multiple pathogens may be present in a single specimen, and the interpretation of the results may be complex.
** 39. Laboratory diagnosis of urinary tract infections. specimen collection, transport, microbiological detection, isolation and identification, expected causative agents, interpretation.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by a wide variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens, and the laboratory diagnosis of these infections involves several steps. Here is a general overview of the process:

+ Specimen collection: Suitable specimens for the laboratory diagnosis of UTIs may include urine, blood, and swabs of the urinary tract. Proper collection and handling of the specimen are important to prevent contamination and ensure accurate results. For example, it is important to collect a "clean-catch" urine specimen, in which the patient cleans the genital area before collecting a midstream urine sample.

+ Transport of the specimen: The specimen should be transported to the laboratory as soon as possible after collection, and appropriate precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of infection. The specimen may be placed in a special transport media to preserve the viability of the pathogens.

+ Microbial detection: The presence of pathogens in the urine specimen can be detected using various methods, such as microscopy or rapid diagnostic assays (such as dipstick tests).

+ Microbial isolation and identification: If pathogens are detected in the urine specimen, they may be cultured (grown) on nutrient media to allow for their isolation and identification. Different media may be used to support the growth of different types of bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Once the pathogens have been isolated, various techniques can be used to identify them, such as biochemical tests, serological tests, and molecular techniques such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction).

+ Expected causative agents: UTIs are typically caused by bacteria, and the most common causative agents are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Other bacteria may also be responsible for UTIs, depending on the location and circumstances of the infection.

/Interpretation of results: The results of the laboratory tests are then reported to the clinician, who interprets the results and uses them to guide treatment decisions. It is important to note that multiple pathogens may be present in a single specimen, and the interpretation of the results may be complex. The clinician will consider the patient's symptoms, the presence and identification of pathogens, and the susceptibility of the pathogens to antimicrobial agents in determining the most appropriate treatment for the infection./
** 40. Laboratory diagnosis of intravascular infections. Blood-culture: rules for specimen collection, maintenance, transport, processing; expected pathogens; interpretation
Intravascular infections are infections that occur within the bloodstream and can be serious, potentially leading to sepsis. A blood culture is a laboratory test that is used to detect the presence of bacteria or fungi in the blood and can be used to diagnose intravascular infections.

The rules for collecting a blood culture specimen vary depending on the specific laboratory, but generally involve the following steps:

+ The healthcare provider should clean the area where the blood will be drawn with an alcohol swab to reduce the risk of contamination.

+ A sterile needle and tubing should be used to draw the blood.

+ The blood should be collected in a sterile container, such as a blood culture bottle.

+ The blood culture bottle should be properly labeled with the patient's information.

To ensure the accuracy of the test, it is important to follow proper procedures for the maintenance, transport, and processing of the blood culture specimen. The blood culture should be transported to the laboratory as soon as possible after collection, and the specimen should be processed according to the laboratory's protocols.

The expected pathogens that may be detected in a blood culture can vary depending on the patient's medical history and risk factors, but common pathogens include bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and fungi such as Candida albicans.

/The interpretation of the results of a blood culture involves identifying the type of microorganism that is present in the blood and determining its sensitivity to different antimicrobial agents. This information is used to guide treatment decisions for the patient./
** 41. Laboratory diagnosis of CNS infections. Microbiological examination of the CSF: rules for specimen collection, maintenance, transport, processing; expected pathogens; interpretation
The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and the spinal cord and is protected by the blood-brain barrier, which makes it more difficult for infections to enter the CNS. However, when an infection does occur, it can be serious and may require prompt treatment. The microbiological examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a laboratory test that can be used to diagnose infections of the CNS.

The rules for collecting a CSF specimen for microbiological examination vary depending on the specific laboratory, but generally involve the following steps:

+ The healthcare provider should clean the area where the CSF will be collected with an alcohol swab to reduce the risk of contamination.

+ A sterile needle and tubing should be used to collect the CSF.

+ The CSF should be collected in a sterile container, such as a sterile tube.

+ The CSF sample should be properly labeled with the patient's information.

To ensure the accuracy of the test, it is important to follow proper procedures for the maintenance, transport, and processing of the CSF specimen. The CSF should be transported to the laboratory as soon as possible after collection, and the specimen should be processed according to the laboratory's protocols.

The expected pathogens that may be detected in a CSF sample can vary depending on the patient's medical history and risk factors, but common pathogens include bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, and viruses such as herpes simplex virus and enterovirus.

** 44. Laboratory Diagnosis of Viral Diseases
The laboratory diagnosis of viral diseases involves the identification of viruses as the cause of an illness or infection. There are several different types of laboratory tests that can be used to diagnose viral infections, including:

+ Viral cultures: In this test, a sample of the virus is collected from the patient and then grown in a laboratory setting. The virus is typically grown in cells or tissues taken from animals or human cell lines. It can take several days to a few weeks for the virus to multiply enough to be detected in the culture. This test is most useful for detecting slow-growing or difficult-to-cultivate viruses, such as herpes viruses and some respiratory viruses.

+ Antigen tests: These tests detect specific proteins (antigens) that are produced by the virus. Antigen tests can be rapid and can provide results in as little as a few hours. They are most useful for detecting infections caused by viruses that produce large amounts of antigens, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.

+ Molecular tests: These tests use techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify and detect the genetic material of the virus. PCR can be very sensitive and can detect even small amounts of virus in a specimen. It can also be used to identify the specific type of virus present. Molecular tests are often used to detect viruses that are difficult to cultivate, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus.

+ Serological tests: These tests detect antibodies in the blood that are produced in response to a viral infection. Antibodies are proteins that are made by the immune system to neutralize or remove viruses from the body. Serological tests can be used to confirm the presence of a past or current viral infection, but may not be useful for detecting acute infections, as it can take several days to a few weeks for the body to produce enough antibodies to be detected.

The specific specimen that is collected and the specific test that is used can vary depending on the type of virus being tested for and the specific laboratory. It is important to follow proper specimen collection and handling procedures to ensure the accuracy of the test results. This may involve using sterile techniques when collecting the specimen and properly labeling and transporting the specimen to the laboratory.

** 45. Viral hemagglutination – basic principle, reading and interpretation of results, application.
Viral hemagglutination is a laboratory technique that is used to identify and characterize viruses. The basic principle of viral hemagglutination is that certain viruses, such as influenza viruses, have proteins on their surface that can bind to red blood cells (RBCs) and cause them to clump or agglutinate. This phenomenon can be used to identify and differentiate between different types of viruses.

To perform a viral hemagglutination assay, a sample of the virus is mixed with a suspension of RBCs. If the virus has hemagglutination activity, the RBCs will clump or agglutinate. The degree of hemagglutination can be quantified by comparing the degree of clumping to a standard curve.

/The reading and interpretation of the results of a viral hemagglutination assay involves comparing the degree of clumping to the standard curve to determine the hemagglutination titer of the virus. A high titer indicates a strong hemagglutination activity, while a low titer indicates a weak or absent hemagglutination activity./

/Viral hemagglutination assays have several applications in virology, including the identification and characterization of viruses, the quantitation of viral titers, and the evaluation of vaccines./
** 46. Hemagglutination-inhibition test (HAI) – basic principle, reading and interpretation of results, application.
The hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) test is a laboratory technique that is used to detect and quantify antibodies to viruses, such as influenza viruses. The basic principle of the HAI test is that antibodies to a specific virus can bind to the virus and inhibit its ability to bind to and agglutinate red blood cells (RBCs).

To perform an HAI test, a sample of the patient's serum is mixed with a suspension of RBCs and a known amount of the virus. If the patient has antibodies to the virus in their serum, these antibodies will bind to the virus and inhibit its ability to bind to and agglutinate the RBCs. The degree of inhibition can be quantified by comparing the degree of hemagglutination to a standard curve.

/The reading and interpretation of the results of an HAI test involves comparing the degree of hemagglutination to the standard curve to determine the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of the patient's serum. A high titer indicates a strong presence of antibodies to the virus, while a low titer indicates a weak or absent presence of antibodies./

/The HAI test has several applications in virology, including the detection and quantitation of antibodies to viruses, the evaluation of vaccines, and the identification of outbreaks of viral infections./
** 47. Neutralization test of viral infectivity - basic principle, reading and interpretation of results, application.
Neutralization tests are used to determine the ability of an antibody or other substance to neutralize a virus. The basic principle of a neutralization test is to add the antibody or other substance to a known amount of virus, and then observe if the virus is still able to infect cells or cause disease symptoms.

To perform a neutralization test, the virus and the test substance (such as an antibody) are mixed together in a laboratory culture dish or in a laboratory animal. The mixture is then incubated for a period of time to allow the virus and test substance to interact. After the incubation period, the mixture is added to a culture of cells or to a laboratory animal to see if the virus is still able to infect the cells or cause disease symptoms.

The results of a neutralization test are typically reported as the highest dilution of the test substance that was able to completely neutralize the virus. For example, a result of 1:10 means that the test substance was able to neutralize the virus when it was diluted to 1 part test substance to 10 parts virus.

Neutralization tests are used to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines, to study the mechanisms of viral infection, and to develop antiviral therapies. They can also be used to identify and characterize antibodies that are produced in response to viral infections.
